      "- I want to draw your attention to the fact that very vivid Tibetan painting has a curious way of creating a state of mind if you really start looking at it that I can only call psychedelic it's I don't know anything else quite like it as you get into the detail of it it's like this let's suppose that you look at some object and instead of the thing becoming fuzzy and fading out it always gets more detailed more clear more alive and you suddenly find out that what you thought was just a bunch of blur was 16,000 maggots with bright eyes on them and that every eye was a deep jewel and you go down into these deep jewel like eyes and you find inside them that there are cross-legged Buddhas with Orioles around them and necklaces of human heads and then you start looking at those and by Jove in every eye on one of those human heads you look inside it and there's another Buddha sitting there see and you go on like that forever and ever and ever in myriad detail see but now that is a state of consciousness which these artists are trying to represent it is the the idea of the Dharmadhatu which I explained in last seminar that is to say the net of jewels where every jewel reflects all the other jewels and therefore naturally contains the reflection of all the other jewels in each other jewel that it reflects you the infinite interrelatedness or they call it mutual penetration of everything in the universe and so this is an art form designed to get you into the mood to understand that by looking at it it is absolute total fascination but what I was trying to describe to you about the nature of these art forms where you look at the details and then you suddenly discover that behind the details there are millions more details and you never fuzz out you find in other words that the possibility to see down into something goes on forever and ever now then that is the visual equivalent of hearing when you work with mantras with these formal chants to get to hear sound in such a way that just as you could say that a visual field is rich in detail like these paintings are like a piece of Hindu beautiful silk weaving which is rich with gold and flowers and you see detail in that now you can hear sound in the same way and that's what Hindu music is playing with and so when you get down into that you see you are what I would call truly listening in to the universe because eventually if you listen to sound that way or you look at form that way you discover its secrets this is just another way of investigation of life comparable to our scientific investigation with microscopes and chemical analysis and this that and the other but it's a different road scientific investigation does what we call looking out into matter into the physical world this is going in the opposite direction but it's all the same thing it's the same continuum but it's going into the nature of your feeling of it that is to say into the center of awareness into the self and what these all these drawings are from various points of view is their drawings of your own interior world looked at in this way under the influence of the traditions of a indeed a particular culture which is not our culture and which therefore strikes us as a little strange but whenever you look at a work of art and you feel gee isn't that weird it's not the way people look you know for people's first impression of Chinese art say they perhaps don't meet Tibetan so easily is that it's um well everything's got curls on it it wiggles it's a very strange and that the the reason for that is that they are showing you a vision of the universe which looked at and so it looks odd to you and what you mean by odd is well it curls where it shouldn't or I don't see things that way I don't see them with that extra flip on them no indeed you don't because the way you see things is what you call ordinary and what you're used to and as you know we when we see things we ignore we screen out certain aspects of things which we don't notice and therefore by studying other people's art forms we are taught to see things that we wouldn't ordinarily notice so that when you become used to Chinese or Tibetan painting you say why of course that's the way the world is also so the feeling of the strange of the we say that we use the word exotic and that means looking a thing looks exotic when you look at it from somebody else's point of view and eventually you get used to it and so if you move into a state of consciousness such as I've been trying to describe that is not the usual kind of state of consciousness you say it's kind of weird isn't it and if you aren't prepared for that you might be afraid of it and say am I going mad am I going out of my mind yes you are you're going out of your set ordinary set of mind but you're going into just another aspect of mind and at first it always feels weird that's why people have difficulty in meditation when they really start moving they say well I'm going to go out of my mind if I think about that you know all those famous stories about people who invented computers and went mad or who thought about the nature of thought and absolutely were never heard from again there's a certain fear in other words of the loss of one's own ego of the sort of regular world where conventions go on where the familiar gestures are made so that you feel at home and you get into other dimensions of awareness where the gestures are different the nerves are doing something else or in Eden you don't know whether they're even nerves anymore they may be Adi Buddhas and all these charming girls who you see in these things and you don't know who they are some kind of weird Tibetan fantasy you say oh this will get cultural shock bear away from that but isn't cultural shock with respect to some other people it's cultural shock with respect to your own inner life in other words that we all have in us levels of vibration which we are not used to not familiar with and therefore are scared of so this particular kind of Buddhism Vagrayana is a rather adventurous not to say dangerous exploration of man's inner consciousness depicting it in an elaborate symbolism which although to a westerner used to Christian symbolism looks as if it were a drawing of some heaven somewhere of potentate seated on thrones and receiving homage and all that political bit all these are quite definitely I'm not in making this up all these are quite definitely to be understood as exterior of your own being in other words let us suppose that we looked on a microscope slide at the cross-section of a spinal column or of an area of the brain this would show us certain designs certain patterns and they would be rather central to you now these are equivalent to those but they are moving in a different direction and you have to understand now the difference between what is called the material body and the subtle body the rupa actually that means the formal body as I explained last second seminar the word rupa in Sanskrit which apply is applied to the material world means the world of form the world seen in a certain form a form to which we are accustomed so you have a formal body which is you as you appear to any other objective observer then you have a subtle body which is the way you are as you feel to yourself in other words supposing you've been on a drunk and you wake up with a headache and it feels that your head is so big well that's the shape of your subtle body Spiegelberg used to show a wonderful cartoon of Corky in the comics looking at a plane going over which was doing some stunts and it made his neck grow longer and longer until it all got tied in knots while watching the plane that was the shape of Corky's subtle body which is called his linga sharira in Sanskrit as opposed to stula sharira which is your gross body that means more dense now so when you get the drawing of the the microscope slide of say a cross section of the spine or something that is quite fundamental to the structure of nervous system you've got a design of the gross body but when you start looking into the other direction of things which is how you feel and you really go into feeling to what sound is to what touch is to what emotion is and you trace the senses back along their channels till you get to the mano-vijnana which is the central sense behind each separate sense and you find that it isn't just kind of a goo it's an incredibly detailed experience and then you draw pictures like this to represent what you found we would draw them in a different way if we genuinely made this inquiry ourselves because we have different traditions and we would find ourselves goodness only knows what we'd be drawing but we would be making things like the stained glass windows in Sharjah Cathedral you see and crucifixes because when you investigate sensation you go down into it and you feel it getting more and more intense more and more intense more more more you see right down this how much can you stand well there's Jesus on the cross cover it with jewels make it gorgeous so all these things you see are investigations of the basic sensation of being alive and people are curious about that you know where are we what's it all about well the only way is to look and see so if you want to find out what you mean by meaning by asking a question by being conscious by being here well you have to meditate and meditation as not meditating on something like thinking it out in an intellectual way it is looking more closely at what you're asking the question about so you could do that externally with a microscope with chemical analysis and so on that way is valid but it has to be balanced by the internal way going down into your own sensation and your own consciousness and the point that I am going to make again in another way that I made this morning is that this isn't something you're supposed to do that is to say isn't a chore it isn't your solemn duty unless you want to come on that's the sort of person you ought to be this is a delight to get into that out of total fascination and joy and love of whatever it is that you are and everybody else's so that this is a different spirit of religion than that to which we are normally accustomed instead of saying which I suppose is an attitude characteristic of what you might call a patris that's distinct from a matris culture go and read your Bible get down on your knees and repent see ooh we feel free pretty spooked by that attitude this one says instead I've got something to show you look in here you all know what all this is about you watch take a look you look in there and you say oh no it can't really be like that you look at this other guy was the Guru's he says it's all right don't be afraid oh that's not possible and this is the attitude and I don't know how to suggest it except by this sort of drama of the two different approaches so this then is the as near as I can get to describing it the inner meaning of tantra of an attitude which is common to both Hinduism and Buddhism they say tantra it means not only the web the warp and the wolf where you can't have yes without no you can't have this direction without having this that direction because this direction to have it there needs this other one to hang on to but he says no look here I gotta have something to hang on to too so we hang on to each other and so there we are see that's the nature of a web and so tantra means the comprehension of the unity of opposites of the good and the bad of life and death of love and hate of all extremes in the whole spectrum of our emotions our sensations everything in the sense this is not something for children because you have to be reliable to get into this because otherwise you go berserk you wouldn't pay any respect to any rules or anything if you didn't have a mature attitude before getting mixed up in this because you suddenly see anything and everything goes there is no way of being wrong because you are it whatever there is forever and ever and ever and that's so you can die fantastic forget everything altogether blow right out come back because the light is the other side of the darkness be all new again but it's all you just as it was before because you do the same patterns same kind of stars same kind of physical properties the same dance blot it out it starts again just like the physical forces and things you see repeat their fundamental laws and patterns it's exactly the same with the inner world i'm talking about investigating the outer world investigating the inner world it's all one and that's you so the buddhist enlightenment is simply to know that secret and that's what it means really finally to grow up you see again just as i said that we find in our own preachers and religious people an attitude of against lifeness and we get a funny feeling about that but they're they're full of reprimands and they're full of there's a trap you see and they have the young people's fellowship as i explained to suck you into this trap there's exactly the same thing exists here in particular i think one of the basic tantric texts is called the Treasury of Songs by Professor Gunther of the University of Saskatchewan.\n",
      "-Saraha was a tantric teacher living probably in the area of Bengal about 1000 AD.\n",
      "-He is making a critique of both the Hindu and Buddhist orthodoxy.\n",
      "-So he says the Brahmins who do not know the truth recite the four Vedas in vain with earth and water and kusha grass they make preparations and seated at home they kindle fire and from the senseless offerings that they make they burn their eyes with the pungent smoke in lordly garb with one staff or three they think themselves wise with their Brahmanical law vainly is the world enslaved by their vanity they do not know that the Dharma is the same as the non-Dharma with ashes these masters smear their bodies and on their heads they wear matted hair seated within the house they kindle lamps seated in a corner they tinkle bells they adopt a posture and fix their eyes whispering in ears and deceiving folk teaching widows and bald-headed nuns and suchlike initiating them as they take their fee the giant monks mock the way with their appearance with their long nails and their filthy clothes or else naked and with disheveled hair enslaving themselves with their doctrine of liberation if by nakedness one is released then dogs and jackals must be so if from absence of hair there comes perfection then the hips of maidens must be so if from having a tail there comes release then for the peacock and yak it must be so if wisdom consists in eating just what one finds then for elephant and horse it must be so for these giant monks there is no release Sarah says deprived of the truth of happiness they do but afflict their own bodies then there are the novices and bhikshu that means a Buddhist monk with the teaching of the old school that's not the same as old school Thai means the whole school of Theravada Buddhism with teaching the old school who renounced the world to be monks some are seen sitting and reading the scriptures some wither away in their concentration on thought others have recourse to the Mahayana this is the doctrine which expounds the original text they say others just meditate on mandala circles others strive to define the fourth stage of bliss with such investigating they fall from the way some would envisage it as space others endow it with the nature of voidness and thus they are generally in disagreement whoever deprived of the innate that's what you really are seeks nirvana can in no wise acquire the absolute truth whoever is intent on anything else how may he gain release will one gain release abiding in meditation what's the use of lamps what's the use of offerings what's to be done by reliance on mantras what's the use of austerities what's the use of going on pilgrimage is release achieved by bathing in water abandon such false attachments and renounce such illusion\n",

      "- I was discussing last night the Bodhisattva doctrine in Mahayana Buddhism and comparing it or relating it to the two great tendencies in Indian spirituality anti-worldliness or otherworldliness and world affirmation and showing how the idea that the highest kind of a Buddha is in a certain way a non-Buddha.\n",
      "-The highest kind of a Buddha is like an ordinary person and this comes out very very much in various tendencies in Zen where for example all the painting peculiarly characteristic of Zen Buddhism in the Chinese and Japanese tradition is as it were secular it has a peculiarly non-religious atmosphere that is to say the painting of Shingon sect and Tendai sect as you saw it in the museum today was religious painting you could tell at once that the subject matter of these paintings is religious but with Zen painting the way of dealing with philosophical on spiritual themes is secular so that when an artist like Sengai living in the 17th century Japan paints the Buddha there is something slightly humorous about the Buddha he wears his halo over one ear there is an informality a slight roughness and so this comes from China from those great song artists like Liang Kai who painted the six patriarch of Zen chopping bamboos looking like the most extraordinarily unkempt country oaf so also the greatest Zen painting has as its subject matter not really religious themes at all it uses pine branches rocks bamboos grasses everything of that kind and you would never know that these things were icons likewise also in poetry which we will go into more extensively in the future the superb expression of Zen poetry is derived from the Chinese poet Hōkōji who says wondrous action supernatural power drawing water carrying fuel now that's that poem is a little bit too religious for Zen taste and so preferable to that is Barsho's famous poem the old pond a frog jumps in plop plop is the only possible English translation for the Japanese means no auto which means literally the waters sound plop but that poem you see is very high styles end poem because it has nothing in it about religion there is a poem on the edge which also was written by Barsho which says when the lightning flashes how admirable he who does not think life is fleeting you see the flash of a lightning is a Buddhist cliche for the transiency of the world your life goes by and disappears as fast as a flash of lightning that becomes a cliche so all religion all religious comments about life eventually become cliches religion always is falling apart and becoming a certain kind of going through the motions a kind of imitation of attitudes as if one would say we've got a book called the imitation of Christ to terrible book because everybody who imitates Christ is a kind of a fake Jesus so in the same way there's all kinds of imitation Buddhas not just sitting on altars made of wood gilded but just sitting around in monasteries so one might say then that the highest kind of religious or spiritual attainment has no no way a sign about it that it is religious or that it is spiritual and so as a metaphor for this there was used in Buddhism from the very beginning the idea of the tracks of birds in the sky they don't leave any tracks and so the way of the enlightened man is like the track of a bird in the sky and as one poem a Chinese poem says entering the forest he does not disturb a blade of grass entering the water he does not make a ripple in other words there is no sign about him to indicate that he is self-consciously religious and this goes to for the fact that he's not having any religious sign is also not something contrived it isn't like Protestant simplicity you know all those Catholics with their rituals and how dreadful and the sincere that is with the real reason you know why Protestant think Catholic ritual is insincere you know it's expensive Protestantism started in the burger cities of Europe places like Freiburg you know and Geneva because the merchant class who were the foundation of the bourgeoisie got annoyed because every time a Saints Day came around all their employees got a day off because it was a holy day and they had to attend mass there were so many of these nuisance holy days and all these contributions that were assessed by the church buying your way out of purgatory and saying masses for the dead and so on and so forth they found this not very economical the priests were getting the money instead of the merchants and so they decried as unbiblical and irreligious and wasteful all the finery of the Catholic religion and wanted something plain and simple so it became in course of time a sign of being really religious to avoid rituals and to avoid colorful clothing and splendor in churches and to be as ordinary as possible but that is not yet the real religion of me giving no sign of having a religion because this simplicity and absence of ritual itself becomes a sign a way of advertising how spiritual you are so the completely bodhisattva type of person doesn't leave any track either by being religious overtly or by being non-religious overtly how will you be neither religious nor non-religious see that's the great test how will you avoid that trap of being one or the other it's like are you a theist or are you an atheist see the theist is caught by God and the idea of God the belief in God but the atheist is equally caught because an atheist is very often an atheist because he cannot stand the idea that God is watching him all the time that there is this constant all-seeing eye prying on your most private life and that there's this you know how when you're a child in school and you're writing something or doing arithmetic and the teacher walks around the class and looks over your shoulder nobody wants to be watched like that even someone who is good at writing or arithmetic doesn't want somebody looking over their shoulder while they're doing it it puts you off it bugs you so the idea of the Lord God who is watching us all the time who is judging everything that we do puts people off and they can't stand it so better be an atheist to get rid of teacher so but the atheist you see the man who advertises his disbelief in God is a very pious person nobody believes in God like an atheist there is no God and I am his prophet so then the true bodhisattva state is very difficult to pin down as being either neither supremely religious nor blatantly secular and people who think that the height of Buddhism or the height of Zen is to be perfectly ordinary have still missed the point like the atheist has missed the point but for this reason then there is an element in the art the painting etc which has been inspired by this kind of Buddhism this kind of art where the subject matter is non-religious nevertheless there is something about the way in which this non-religious subject matter is handled that stops you and you know there's something strange about it this is how I first became interested in oriental philosophy and all that kind of thing I had an absolute fascination for Chinese and Japanese painting the secular painting the landscapes the treatment of flowers and grasses and bamboos there was something about it that struck me as astonishing even though the subject matter was extremely ordinary and I just as a child practically I had to find out what was the strange element in those bamboos and those grasses I was being of course taught by those painters to see grass but there was something in there that one could never pin down never put your finger on and that was this thing that I will call the religion of no religion the supreme attainment of being a Buddha who can't be detected who in this sense then leaves no trace you remember some of you have seen those ten paintings called the ten stages of spiritual ox herding and the the author there are two sets of these paintings there's a heterodox one and an orthodox one the heterodox one has the as the man catches the ox it gets progressively whiter until in the end it disappears altogether and the last picture is an empty circle but the orthodox set of paintings doesn't end with the empty circle that the empty circle arises two from the end three from the end it is followed by two others after the man has attained the state of emptiness the state in other words of complete iconoclasm the state of no attachment to any spiritual or psychological or moral crutch there are two more steps one is called returning to the origin which is represented by a tree beside a stream and the final one called entering the city with hands hanging down that means the hands giving a handout as it were giving bounty and it shows the picture of the fat Buddha putai or in Japanese known as Hotei who is an enormous belly big ears who carries around a colossal bag and what do you think this bag has in it trash wonderful trash everything that children love things that everybody else has thrown away and thought of as valueless this bum collects and gives it away to children and so it says here that he goes on his way without following the steps of the ancient sages his door is closed his kids that's the door of his house and no glimpses of his interior life are to be seen so in other words it's like when you erect a building while you're building it you have all kinds of scaffolding up that shows you that building is going on but when the building is complete the scaffolding is taken down to open a door as they say in Zen you may need to pick up a brick to knock at the door but when the door is open you don't carry the brick inside to cross the river you need a boat but when you reach the other side you don't pick up the boat and carry it so the brick the boat the scaffolding all these things represent some sort of religious technology or and in the end these are all to disappear so that the saint will not be found in church I don't take what I say literally the saint can perfectly readily go to church without being sullied by church but ordinary people when they go to church they come out stinking of religion there was a great Zen master once and one of his disciples asked him how am I making progress he said you're all right but you have a trivial fault well what is that he said you have too much Zen well he said when you're studying Zen don't you think it's very natural to be talking about it the master said when it's like an ordinary conversation it is much better and so another monk who was standing by listening to this exchange said to the master why do you so specially dislike talking about Zen and he replied because it turns one's stomach so what did he mean when he said when it's like an ordinary everyday conversation it is somewhat better when the old master joshua was asked at the end of the kalpa when everything is destroyed in fire there will be one thing remaining what is that and joshua replied it's windy again this morning so in Zen when you're asked a question about religion you reply in terms of the secular when you are asked about something secular you reply in terms of religion so what is the eternal nature of the self it's windy again this morning please pass me a knife the master hands him the knife with a blade first please give me the other end what would you do with the other end see here the disciple starts out with the ordinary please pass me the knife and suddenly he finds himself involved in a metaphysical problem but if he starts out with the metaphysical he's going to get involved with a knife so now to go deeply into the religion of non-religion we have to understand the what you might call the final ultimate attainment of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy and this is contained in a school of thought which is called in Chinese Hua Yan and in Japanese kegon kegon is the intellectual foundation for Zen and there was a great Chinese master by the name of Schumann who was simultaneously a Zen master and the fifth patriarch of the Huan Yan sect.\n",
      "-Huan means flower.\n",
      "-Yan garland, the garland of flowers and it's all based on a Sanskrit sutra called avatamsaka this is called simply the in Japanese kegonkyo very big sutra and the subject matter of this sutra are what are called the four Dharma worlds and I must explain what these four worlds are so that you get the point first of all there is a level of being which we will call ji the word ji which is Japanese way of pronouncing the Chinese ch'er is the world of things and events what you might call the common sense world the everyday world that our senses normally record this the word ji the character in Chinese has a multiplicity of meanings because it can mean a thing or an event it can also mean business an affair not in a love affair but something in the way the French say les affaires for business something important it can also mean affectation putting something on or showing off and so a person who is a master in Zen is called buji which means no business no affectation nothing special the poem says on Mount Lu there is misty rain and the river Jiang is at high tide when you have not been there your heart is filled with longing but when you have been there and come back it was nothing special misty rain on Mount Lu River Jiang at high tide but this nothing special is not a way of putting something down do you see that I could say well it was nothing special it didn't really amount to anything that's one way of saying it was very ordinary but buji just as it doesn't mean it was very ordinary in the same way that the person who has no religion is really the most religious you do see he's not just a common ignorant moron he looks like one but he isn't and you have to know what he knows in order to see that he isn't and to recognize him for what he is so nothing special buji it doesn't stand out it doesn't as we would say that doesn't stick out like a sore thumb so the world of G then means generally the world of particulars the world of multiplicity the world we ordinarily feel we're involved in so that's the first world the second world is called the world of re now re in Chinese Lee is as I explained to you when we were discussing the idea of the law of nature the character means the markings in jade or the grain in wood or the fiber in muscle but in the Hawaiian philosophy the word re means the universal underlying all particulars the one underlying all multiplicity the unity of principle as distinct from G which is the differentiation principle so as it were like it's like this when you see into the nature of this world you start from G you start from noticing all the particular things and being baffled by their multiplicity and dealing with the multiplicity of things but as you go into this you discover as you understand things what do you mean when you understand things it means you become aware of their relationships to each other and eventually you see the unity behind them and it is as if the multiplicity of the world dissolved into unity you start from noticing all the particular things and being baffled by their multiplicity and dealing with the multiplicity of things but as you go into this you discover as you understand things what do you mean when you understand things it means you become aware of their relationships to each other and eventually you see the unity behind them and it is as if the multiplicity of the world dissolved into unity and so here you encounter a problem I can see the world as a unity I can see the world as a multiplicity but how the devil am I going to put the two visions together if I am to be a practical success in business in family life and so on I have to observe the world of particulars its particulars that matter I have to know chalk from cheese but if I become a saint a monk or a hermit then I care of even perhaps a poet or an artist I will forget about the practical matters and contemplate the unity the secret meaning underlying all events but then every all those practical people are going to say to me you're you're falling down on the job you've escaped from life because they feel that the world of particulars is the real world but the other guy says no your particulars are not real you make a success of things yes but it's completely temporary you think you're an important person that you are really contributing to human life but actually your success in doing this sort of thing lasts for a few years and then you fall apart like everybody else does where's your success now when you're dead what happened to the millions of dollars you made where are you they're all gone so that isn't real from the standpoint of the person who concentrates on the unity so then to perfect our understanding we have to go to the third of these worlds which is called re G mu gay now that means between a re the unity and G the particulars mu there is no gay block that means the world of the universal and the particulars are not incompatible let's take two very different things and see how they can be united take shape and color never in a million years can you with a black pencil that can draw shapes make red but if you have read you can draw a circle you can draw a red circle even though the circle shape and the red color will never be the same yet red circle they go beautifully together so think of circle as G and red as re the circle is the particular the color is the universal they go together so then we might say the properly rounded out person is both spiritual and material both otherworldly and worldly this is the supreme attainment of a human being to be both don't get one-sided a person who is what you might call just a materialist ends up by being very boring it's you know you can live the successful life of the world and you can own every kind of material refinement you can have the most beautiful home delicious food marvelous yachts and cars and everything but if you have no touch of mysticism it eventually is all perfectly boring and you get tired of it then on the other hand there are people who are purely spiritual and they live in a kind of dry world where all luxury has been scrubbed away and they are very intense people when you are in their presence of a very spiritual person an excessively spiritual person you feel inclined to sit on the edge of your chair you are not at ease because you know the eye of judgment is looking through you and going down into your very soul and finding that you're just a scallywag after all and he has this absolutely sincere this dreadfully honest and unselfish person this is something which is always puzzling to people brought up in a Western environment because great spiritual people are often very very sensuous because they they can't be materialists in the ordinary sense they can't be straight open sensuous because for them the world is too wonderful for that any any human being is too marvelous to be treated as just a kind of sexual object they may be very much a sexual object but so marvelous you have to stop with it and really go into the whole of that marvelous wonderful personality so there is a trouble keeps coming up for the West when you go to church and you suddenly go to a church where there's a marvelous clergyman and you think he is the very exemplar of life and you idealize him and then suddenly there develops a frightful scandal that he has an affair with his secretary and you think all is lost that the faith has been sold out that everything's going to rack and ruin because he was not purely spiritual and he himself may be terribly confused and worried about this because in our world you see we make the spiritual and the material mutually exclusive but re ji mu ge this third world means that between the spiritual and the material there is no obstruction so we might say this would sound as if it were the highest level but is one more to come which is called ji ji mu ge this means then suddenly re has disappeared but between ji and ji there is no obstruction between one event and any other event or events there is no mutual exclusiveness shall I put it that way this is the doctrine the highest doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism which you could call the doctrine of the mutual interpenetration of all things or the mutual interdependence of all things and its symbol is the what is called Indra's net that is used in the avatamsaka sutra imagine at dawn and multi-dimensional spider's web covered in dew a vast vast spider's web that is the whole cosmos and is not only a kind of a flat thing but a solid thing and has solid in four five six and n dimensions covered with jewels of dew all of which have rainbow coloring and every drop of dew contains in it the reflection of every other drop of dew and since every drop of dew contains the reflections of all the others each reflected drop of dew contains the reflections you see of all the others and so ad infinitum now this is the Mahayana vision of the world which is to say this is relativity that whatever exists in this world and is characterized as something particular as a thing as an event has something or other you see as a unit this does not exist without all other such things and events so that you might say any one event implies all events and all events the total universe past present and future depends on every single member in other words you may say I can understand that I depend on this whole universe there could not be me unless there was everything else it is harder to see the corollary of that that the whole universe depends on you you might say well how can that be because I come into being and then I go out of being and when I'm before I was born I'm sure the universe was here and after I die I'm sure it will go on how can you say then that the whole thing depends on me very simply it depends on your supposing you're dead and we are talking about someone in the past let's say we're talking about Socrates and I'm going to say this whole universe depends on Socrates I may put it more exactly it depends on Socrates having existed you see your parents now some of your parents may be alive but some of your parents may be dead without your parents he would not have come into being so you depend on your parents even when your parents have gone so everything even when you disappear the universe will still depend on you on your having been here or if you have not yet arrived it depends on your going to be here so we can say obviously going back to Socrates that the fact that Socrates existed tells us something about the kind of world we're living in this world once Socrates and that Socrates and his wisdom was a symptom of the kind of universe we're living in in just the same way as I showed you that an apple is a symptom of a tree certain kind of tree tells us something about that tree what it functions how it produces things so a world which produced Socrates or a world which produced John Doe who was nobody in particular and nobody ever remembered him or thought to write his biography nevertheless for all his obscurity the whole universe depends on him and it depends equally on every fruit fly every gnat every vibration of every gnats wing and it depends on every last electron however brief its manifestation may be so that what what this is saying is that everything that there is implies everything else and all those other things collectively in their totality which we call the universe in turn imply each individual object event and so on that's the meaning of Indra's net so that this is called in Zen to take up a blade of grass and use it as a golden Buddha 16 feet high when you have a chain and you pick up a link all the other links come up with it you see because it implies if this is a link it is a link in a chain if it isn't it's just an oval piece of metal but if it's a link up come all other links so if you are an event every event no no there's no such thing as a single event the only possible single event is all events whatsoever that could be regarded as the only possible atom the only possible single thing is everything but the things that we call things all imply each other we know what we are only in relation to what we aren't we know of the sensation of oneself only in relation to a sensation of something other so the other goes with the self as the back goes with the front and your life however short everything depends on it if that did not happen nothing would happen so in this sense the whole world bears your signature it would not be the same world if it weren't for you you've heard haven't you what is called the pathetic fallacy this was a idea of the 19th century which said that it was false wrong to project human feelings on the world the wind in the pine trees is not sighing it's you who are sighing the Sun is not happy it's you are who are happy when the sun shines so don't mix up your happiness with the Sun the Sun has no feeling the Sun is not human the wind has no feeling and is not human the poet says the moon doth with delight look round her when the heavens are bare and the logician says no the poet looks round with the light of the moon in the bare heavens how awful I mean if that's what if that's the point you see better not say any poetry just have prose but actually the moon does look round with the light when the poet looks round with the light because the world of which one symptom is the moon is the same world of which another symptom is the poet they go together a world where there is a moon implies a world where there is a poet a world where there is a poet implies a world where there is a moon so in this sense the moon can be said to look round with the light through the agency of the poet because you can't separate poet and moon just as you can't separate head and feet without destroying the unity of the body so in that sense then this whole world is a human world and we should not take the silly attitude philosophy called the philosophy of the pathetic fallacy which says outside our skins it's all inhuman and dumb and blind force and only inside the skin is there a human world all this world is human because it depends not only on the existence of humanity in general but on the existence of Mary Smith in particular so the whole world is covered as it were with your personal signature but at that moment when you suddenly seem to be everything and to be Mr.\n",
      "-A you know you suddenly see the obverse of this that your particular personality is nothing at all without everything else without everybody else I need in order to be Alan Watts I need every single other human being and the uncontrollable otherness of all those other human beings that I can't do anything about they are going to be themselves whatever I do and yet at the same time I depend on all their difference from me and yet they all depend likewise on me so that I'm in a very funny position the moment I would be egoless and say I am nothing without you then suddenly I find I'm the kingpin they all depend on me then suddenly when I get swelled headed about being the kingpin I find I'm nothing at all without them so everything keeps going blip blip blip blip in other words the moment you think you've got it in one state it transforms itself into the other that's the Gigi Muge now in Gigi Muge you see you've got a vision of the world in which everybody is boss and nobody is boss there is no one boss who governs the whole thing it takes care of itself it's a colossal democracy but yet every man and every uguisu and every snail is king in this world and at the same time is commoner and that's how it works and there is no great king although in Hinduism they have an idea a very strange one to us called Ishvara Ishvara means the supreme personal God the top being in the deva world and they many Buddhists believe that there is such a God there is a ruler of the universe but he is lower than a Buddha because in the course of the endless cycles Ishvara will dissolve into nothing all gods all angels are within the round of being it's a very curious idea to our our minds and therefore although Buddhists believe in God in that sense they don't take it importantly there are no shrines in Buddhism to Ishvara so then it is through Gigi Muge this idea of the mutual interpenetration and interdependence of all things that we have the philosophical basis for Zen as a practical non-intellectual way of life because of the realization that the most ordinary event the charcoal brazier the mat soup for dinner sneezing washing your hands going to the bathroom everything all these so-called events separate events imply the universe so this is why Zen people will use the ordinary event to demonstrate the cosmic and the metaphysical only they don't rationalize it that way to see infinity in a grain of sand and eternity in an hour is still Rigi Muge and not Gigi Muge Gigi Muge is when you offer somebody the grain of sand for God's sake stop thinking about eternity here's just the grain of sand there is no difference between the grain of sand and eternity so you don't have to think about eternity as something implied by the grain of sand the grain of sand is eternity so in the same way exactly our sitting here at this moment is not something different from Nirvana we are Nirvana as sitting here exactly like this you see so you don't have to say any philosophical comment on the grain of sand or on our sitting here that's called legs on a snake or a beard on a unit you put legs on a snake you see and you embarrass the snake in its motion and a unit doesn't need a beard we would say in our idiom don't guild the lily or Zen would say don't put frost on top of snow so all what you might call specifically religious activity is legs on a snake eventually this is going to be eliminated just as eventually we hope that government will be eliminated and will become unnecessary because every individual will be self-governing and therefore relate properly to his brother and the state will vanish so too at the same time the church will vanish and that's why in the in the book of Revelation in the New Testament it is said that in heaven there is no temple because the whole place is the temple so in when we achieve the fulfillment of Buddhism there is no Buddha no temple no gong no bell because the whole world is the sound of the bell and the image of Buddha is everything you can look at so as then master was asked mountains and hills are they not all forms of the body of Buddha the master replied yes they are but it's a pity to say so\n",

      "+ I want to draw your attention to the fact that very vivid Tibetan painting has a curious way of creating a state of mind if you really start looking at it that I can only call psychedelic it's I don't know anything else quite like it as you get into the detail of it it's like this let's suppose that you look at some object and instead of the thing becoming fuzzy and fading out it always gets more detailed more clear more alive and you suddenly find out that what you thought was just a bunch of blur was 16,000 maggots with bright eyes on them and that every eye was a deep jewel and you go down into these deep jewel like eyes and you find inside them that there are cross-legged Buddhas with Orioles around them and necklaces of human heads and then you start looking at those and by Jove in every eye on one of those human heads you look inside it and there's another Buddha sitting there see and you go on like that forever and ever and ever in myriad detail see but now that is a state of consciousness which these artists are trying to represent it is the the idea of the Dharmadhatu which I explained in last seminar that is to say the net of jewels where every jewel reflects all the other jewels and therefore naturally contains the reflection of all the other jewels in each other jewel that it reflects you the infinite interrelatedness or they call it mutual penetration of everything in the universe and so this is an art form designed to get you into the mood to understand that by looking at it it is absolute total fascination but what I was trying to describe to you about the nature of these art forms where you look at the details and then you suddenly discover that behind the details there are millions more details and you never fuzz out you find in other words that the possibility to see down into something goes on forever and ever now then that is the visual equivalent of hearing when you work with mantras with these formal chants to get to hear sound in such a way that just as you could say that a visual field is rich in detail like these paintings are like a piece of Hindu beautiful silk weaving which is rich with gold and flowers and you see detail in that now you can hear sound in the same way and that's what Hindu music is playing with and so when you get down into that you see you are what I would call truly listening in to the universe because eventually if you listen to sound that way or you look at form that way you discover its secrets this is just another way of investigation of life comparable to our scientific investigation with microscopes and chemical analysis and this that and the other but it's a different road scientific investigation does what we call looking out into matter into the physical world this is going in the opposite direction but it's all the same thing it's the same continuum but it's going into the nature of your feeling of it that is to say into the center of awareness into the self and what these all these drawings are from various points of view is their drawings of your own interior world looked at in this way under the influence of the traditions of a indeed a particular culture which is not our culture and which therefore strikes us as a little strange but whenever you look at a work of art and you feel gee isn't that weird it's not the way people look you know for people's first impression of Chinese art say they perhaps don't meet Tibetan so easily is that it's um well everything's got curls on it it wiggles it's a very strange and that the the reason for that is that they are showing you a vision of the universe which looked at and so it looks odd to you and what you mean by odd is well it curls where it shouldn't or I don't see things that way I don't see them with that extra flip on them no indeed you don't because the way you see things is what you call ordinary and what you're used to and as you know we when we see things we ignore we screen out certain aspects of things which we don't notice and therefore by studying other people's art forms we are taught to see things that we wouldn't ordinarily notice so that when you become used to Chinese or Tibetan painting you say why of course that's the way the world is also so the feeling of the strange of the we say that we use the word exotic and that means looking a thing looks exotic when you look at it from somebody else's point of view and eventually you get used to it and so if you move into a state of consciousness such as I've been trying to describe that is not the usual kind of state of consciousness you say it's kind of weird isn't it and if you aren't prepared for that you might be afraid of it and say am I going mad am I going out of my mind yes you are you're going out of your set ordinary set of mind but you're going into just another aspect of mind and at first it always feels weird that's why people have difficulty in meditation when they really start moving they say well I'm going to go out of my mind if I think about that you know all those famous stories about people who invented computers and went mad or who thought about the nature of thought and absolutely were never heard from again there's a certain fear in other words of the loss of one's own ego of the sort of regular world where conventions go on where the familiar gestures are made so that you feel at home and you get into other dimensions of awareness where the gestures are different the nerves are doing something else or in Eden you don't know whether they're even nerves anymore they may be Adi Buddhas and all these charming girls who you see in these things and you don't know who they are some kind of weird Tibetan fantasy you say oh this will get cultural shock bear away from that but isn't cultural shock with respect to some other people it's cultural shock with respect to your own inner life in other words that we all have in us levels of vibration which we are not used to not familiar with and therefore are scared of so this particular kind of Buddhism Vagrayana is a rather adventurous not to say dangerous exploration of man's inner consciousness depicting it in an elaborate symbolism which although to a westerner used to Christian symbolism looks as if it were a drawing of some heaven somewhere of potentate seated on thrones and receiving homage and all that political bit all these are quite definitely I'm not in making this up all these are quite definitely to be understood as exterior of your own being in other words let us suppose that we looked on a microscope slide at the cross-section of a spinal column or of an area of the brain this would show us certain designs certain patterns and they would be rather central to you now these are equivalent to those but they are moving in a different direction and you have to understand now the difference between what is called the material body and the subtle body the rupa actually that means the formal body as I explained last second seminar the word rupa in Sanskrit which apply is applied to the material world means the world of form the world seen in a certain form a form to which we are accustomed so you have a formal body which is you as you appear to any other objective observer then you have a subtle body which is the way you are as you feel to yourself in other words supposing you've been on a drunk and you wake up with a headache and it feels that your head is so big well that's the shape of your subtle body Spiegelberg used to show a wonderful cartoon of Corky in the comics looking at a plane going over which was doing some stunts and it made his neck grow longer and longer until it all got tied in knots while watching the plane that was the shape of Corky's subtle body which is called his linga sharira in Sanskrit as opposed to stula sharira which is your gross body that means more dense now so when you get the drawing of the the microscope slide of say a cross section of the spine or something that is quite fundamental to the structure of nervous system you've got a design of the gross body but when you start looking into the other direction of things which is how you feel and you really go into feeling to what sound is to what touch is to what emotion is and you trace the senses back along their channels till you get to the mano-vijnana which is the central sense behind each separate sense and you find that it isn't just kind of a goo it's an incredibly detailed experience and then you draw pictures like this to represent what you found we would draw them in a different way if we genuinely made this inquiry ourselves because we have different traditions and we would find ourselves goodness only knows what we'd be drawing but we would be making things like the stained glass windows in Sharjah Cathedral you see and crucifixes because when you investigate sensation you go down into it and you feel it getting more and more intense more and more intense more more more you see right down this how much can you stand well there's Jesus on the cross cover it with jewels make it gorgeous so all these things you see are investigations of the basic sensation of being alive and people are curious about that you know where are we what's it all about well the only way is to look and see so if you want to find out what you mean by meaning by asking a question by being conscious by being here well you have to meditate and meditation as not meditating on something like thinking it out in an intellectual way it is looking more closely at what you're asking the question about so you could do that externally with a microscope with chemical analysis and so on that way is valid but it has to be balanced by the internal way going down into your own sensation and your own consciousness and the point that I am going to make again in another way that I made this morning is that this isn't something you're supposed to do that is to say isn't a chore it isn't your solemn duty unless you want to come on that's the sort of person you ought to be this is a delight to get into that out of total fascination and joy and love of whatever it is that you are and everybody else's so that this is a different spirit of religion than that to which we are normally accustomed instead of saying which I suppose is an attitude characteristic of what you might call a patris that's distinct from a matris culture go and read your Bible get down on your knees and repent see ooh we feel free pretty spooked by that attitude this one says instead I've got something to show you look in here you all know what all this is about you watch take a look you look in there and you say oh no it can't really be like that you look at this other guy was the Guru's he says it's all right don't be afraid oh that's not possible and this is the attitude and I don't know how to suggest it except by this sort of drama of the two different approaches so this then is the as near as I can get to describing it the inner meaning of tantra of an attitude which is common to both Hinduism and Buddhism they say tantra it means not only the web the warp and the wolf where you can't have yes without no you can't have this direction without having this that direction because this direction to have it there needs this other one to hang on to but he says no look here I gotta have something to hang on to too so we hang on to each other and so there we are see that's the nature of a web and so tantra means the comprehension of the unity of opposites of the good and the bad of life and death of love and hate of all extremes in the whole spectrum of our emotions our sensations everything in the sense this is not something for children because you have to be reliable to get into this because otherwise you go berserk you wouldn't pay any respect to any rules or anything if you didn't have a mature attitude before getting mixed up in this because you suddenly see anything and everything goes there is no way of being wrong because you are it whatever there is forever and ever and ever and that's so you can die fantastic forget everything altogether blow right out come back because the light is the other side of the darkness be all new again but it's all you just as it was before because you do the same patterns same kind of stars same kind of physical properties the same dance blot it out it starts again just like the physical forces and things you see repeat their fundamental laws and patterns it's exactly the same with the inner world i'm talking about investigating the outer world investigating the inner world it's all one and that's you so the buddhist enlightenment is simply to know that secret and that's what it means really finally to grow up you see again just as i said that we find in our own preachers and religious people an attitude of against lifeness and we get a funny feeling about that but they're they're full of reprimands and they're full of there's a trap you see and they have the young people's fellowship as i explained to suck you into this trap there's exactly the same thing exists here in particular i think one of the basic tantric texts is called the Treasury of Songs by Professor Gunther of the University of Saskatchewan.\n",

      "+ I was discussing last night the Bodhisattva doctrine in Mahayana Buddhism and comparing it or relating it to the two great tendencies in Indian spirituality anti-worldliness or otherworldliness and world affirmation and showing how the idea that the highest kind of a Buddha is in a certain way a non-Buddha.\n",
      "+The highest kind of a Buddha is like an ordinary person and this comes out very very much in various tendencies in Zen where for example all the painting peculiarly characteristic of Zen Buddhism in the Chinese and Japanese tradition is as it were secular it has a peculiarly non-religious atmosphere that is to say the painting of Shingon sect and Tendai sect as you saw it in the museum today was religious painting you could tell at once that the subject matter of these paintings is religious but with Zen painting the way of dealing with philosophical on spiritual themes is secular so that when an artist like Sengai living in the 17th century Japan paints the Buddha there is something slightly humorous about the Buddha he wears his halo over one ear there is an informality a slight roughness and so this comes from China from those great song artists like Liang Kai who painted the six patriarch of Zen chopping bamboos looking like the most extraordinarily unkempt country oaf so also the greatest Zen painting has as its subject matter not really religious themes at all it uses pine branches rocks bamboos grasses everything of that kind and you would never know that these things were icons likewise also in poetry which we will go into more extensively in the future the superb expression of Zen poetry is derived from the Chinese poet Hōkōji who says wondrous action supernatural power drawing water carrying fuel now that's that poem is a little bit too religious for Zen taste and so preferable to that is Barsho's famous poem the old pond a frog jumps in plop plop is the only possible English translation for the Japanese means no auto which means literally the waters sound plop but that poem you see is very high styles end poem because it has nothing in it about religion there is a poem on the edge which also was written by Barsho which says when the lightning flashes how admirable he who does not think life is fleeting you see the flash of a lightning is a Buddhist cliche for the transiency of the world your life goes by and disappears as fast as a flash of lightning that becomes a cliche so all religion all religious comments about life eventually become cliches religion always is falling apart and becoming a certain kind of going through the motions a kind of imitation of attitudes as if one would say we've got a book called the imitation of Christ to terrible book because everybody who imitates Christ is a kind of a fake Jesus so in the same way there's all kinds of imitation Buddhas not just sitting on altars made of wood gilded but just sitting around in monasteries so one might say then that the highest kind of religious or spiritual attainment has no no way a sign about it that it is religious or that it is spiritual and so as a metaphor for this there was used in Buddhism from the very beginning the idea of the tracks of birds in the sky they don't leave any tracks and so the way of the enlightened man is like the track of a bird in the sky and as one poem a Chinese poem says entering the forest he does not disturb a blade of grass entering the water he does not make a ripple in other words there is no sign about him to indicate that he is self-consciously religious and this goes to for the fact that he's not having any religious sign is also not something contrived it isn't like Protestant simplicity you know all those Catholics with their rituals and how dreadful and the sincere that is with the real reason you know why Protestant think Catholic ritual is insincere you know it's expensive Protestantism started in the burger cities of Europe places like Freiburg you know and Geneva because the merchant class who were the foundation of the bourgeoisie got annoyed because every time a Saints Day came around all their employees got a day off because it was a holy day and they had to attend mass there were so many of these nuisance holy days and all these contributions that were assessed by the church buying your way out of purgatory and saying masses for the dead and so on and so forth they found this not very economical the priests were getting the money instead of the merchants and so they decried as unbiblical and irreligious and wasteful all the finery of the Catholic religion and wanted something plain and simple so it became in course of time a sign of being really religious to avoid rituals and to avoid colorful clothing and splendor in churches and to be as ordinary as possible but that is not yet the real religion of me giving no sign of having a religion because this simplicity and absence of ritual itself becomes a sign a way of advertising how spiritual you are so the completely bodhisattva type of person doesn't leave any track either by being religious overtly or by being non-religious overtly how will you be neither religious nor non-religious see that's the great test how will you avoid that trap of being one or the other it's like are you a theist or are you an atheist see the theist is caught by God and the idea of God the belief in God but the atheist is equally caught because an atheist is very often an atheist because he cannot stand the idea that God is watching him all the time that there is this constant all-seeing eye prying on your most private life and that there's this you know how when you're a child in school and you're writing something or doing arithmetic and the teacher walks around the class and looks over your shoulder nobody wants to be watched like that even someone who is good at writing or arithmetic doesn't want somebody looking over their shoulder while they're doing it it puts you off it bugs you so the idea of the Lord God who is watching us all the time who is judging everything that we do puts people off and they can't stand it so better be an atheist to get rid of teacher so but the atheist you see the man who advertises his disbelief in God is a very pious person nobody believes in God like an atheist there is no God and I am his prophet so then the true bodhisattva state is very difficult to pin down as being either neither supremely religious nor blatantly secular and people who think that the height of Buddhism or the height of Zen is to be perfectly ordinary have still missed the point like the atheist has missed the point but for this reason then there is an element in the art the painting etc which has been inspired by this kind of Buddhism this kind of art where the subject matter is non-religious nevertheless there is something about the way in which this non-religious subject matter is handled that stops you and you know there's something strange about it this is how I first became interested in oriental philosophy and all that kind of thing I had an absolute fascination for Chinese and Japanese painting the secular painting the landscapes the treatment of flowers and grasses and bamboos there was something about it that struck me as astonishing even though the subject matter was extremely ordinary and I just as a child practically I had to find out what was the strange element in those bamboos and those grasses I was being of course taught by those painters to see grass but there was something in there that one could never pin down never put your finger on and that was this thing that I will call the religion of no religion the supreme attainment of being a Buddha who can't be detected who in this sense then leaves no trace you remember some of you have seen those ten paintings called the ten stages of spiritual ox herding and the the author there are two sets of these paintings there's a heterodox one and an orthodox one the heterodox one has the as the man catches the ox it gets progressively whiter until in the end it disappears altogether and the last picture is an empty circle but the orthodox set of paintings doesn't end with the empty circle that the empty circle arises two from the end three from the end it is followed by two others after the man has attained the state of emptiness the state in other words of complete iconoclasm the state of no attachment to any spiritual or psychological or moral crutch there are two more steps one is called returning to the origin which is represented by a tree beside a stream and the final one called entering the city with hands hanging down that means the hands giving a handout as it were giving bounty and it shows the picture of the fat Buddha putai or in Japanese known as Hotei who is an enormous belly big ears who carries around a colossal bag and what do you think this bag has in it trash wonderful trash everything that children love things that everybody else has thrown away and thought of as valueless this bum collects and gives it away to children and so it says here that he goes on his way without following the steps of the ancient sages his door is closed his kids that's the door of his house and no glimpses of his interior life are to be seen so in other words it's like when you erect a building while you're building it you have all kinds of scaffolding up that shows you that building is going on but when the building is complete the scaffolding is taken down to open a door as they say in Zen you may need to pick up a brick to knock at the door but when the door is open you don't carry the brick inside to cross the river you need a boat but when you reach the other side you don't pick up the boat and carry it so the brick the boat the scaffolding all these things represent some sort of religious technology or and in the end these are all to disappear so that the saint will not be found in church I don't take what I say literally the saint can perfectly readily go to church without being sullied by church but ordinary people when they go to church they come out stinking of religion there was a great Zen master once and one of his disciples asked him how am I making progress he said you're all right but you have a trivial fault well what is that he said you have too much Zen well he said when you're studying Zen don't you think it's very natural to be talking about it the master said when it's like an ordinary conversation it is much better and so another monk who was standing by listening to this exchange said to the master why do you so specially dislike talking about Zen and he replied because it turns one's stomach so what did he mean when he said when it's like an ordinary everyday conversation it is somewhat better when the old master joshua was asked at the end of the kalpa when everything is destroyed in fire there will be one thing remaining what is that and joshua replied it's windy again this morning so in Zen when you're asked a question about religion you reply in terms of the secular when you are asked about something secular you reply in terms of religion so what is the eternal nature of the self it's windy again this morning please pass me a knife the master hands him the knife with a blade first please give me the other end what would you do with the other end see here the disciple starts out with the ordinary please pass me the knife and suddenly he finds himself involved in a metaphysical problem but if he starts out with the metaphysical he's going to get involved with a knife so now to go deeply into the religion of non-religion we have to understand the what you might call the final ultimate attainment of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy and this is contained in a school of thought which is called in Chinese Hua Yan and in Japanese kegon kegon is the intellectual foundation for Zen and there was a great Chinese master by the name of Schumann who was simultaneously a Zen master and the fifth patriarch of the Huan Yan sect.\n",
      "+Huan means flower.\n",
      "+Yan garland, the garland of flowers and it's all based on a Sanskrit sutra called avatamsaka this is called simply the in Japanese kegonkyo very big sutra and the subject matter of this sutra are what are called the four Dharma worlds and I must explain what these four worlds are so that you get the point first of all there is a level of being which we will call ji the word ji which is Japanese way of pronouncing the Chinese ch'er is the world of things and events what you might call the common sense world the everyday world that our senses normally record this the word ji the character in Chinese has a multiplicity of meanings because it can mean a thing or an event it can also mean business an affair not in a love affair but something in the way the French say les affaires for business something important it can also mean affectation putting something on or showing off and so a person who is a master in Zen is called buji which means no business no affectation nothing special the poem says on Mount Lu there is misty rain and the river Jiang is at high tide when you have not been there your heart is filled with longing but when you have been there and come back it was nothing special misty rain on Mount Lu River Jiang at high tide but this nothing special is not a way of putting something down do you see that I could say well it was nothing special it didn't really amount to anything that's one way of saying it was very ordinary but buji just as it doesn't mean it was very ordinary in the same way that the person who has no religion is really the most religious you do see he's not just a common ignorant moron he looks like one but he isn't and you have to know what he knows in order to see that he isn't and to recognize him for what he is so nothing special buji it doesn't stand out it doesn't as we would say that doesn't stick out like a sore thumb so the world of G then means generally the world of particulars the world of multiplicity the world we ordinarily feel we're involved in so that's the first world the second world is called the world of re now re in Chinese Lee is as I explained to you when we were discussing the idea of the law of nature the character means the markings in jade or the grain in wood or the fiber in muscle but in the Hawaiian philosophy the word re means the universal underlying all particulars the one underlying all multiplicity the unity of principle as distinct from G which is the differentiation principle so as it were like it's like this when you see into the nature of this world you start from G you start from noticing all the particular things and being baffled by their multiplicity and dealing with the multiplicity of things but as you go into this you discover as you understand things what do you mean when you understand things it means you become aware of their relationships to each other and eventually you see the unity behind them and it is as if the multiplicity of the world dissolved into unity you start from noticing all the particular things and being baffled by their multiplicity and dealing with the multiplicity of things but as you go into this you discover as you understand things what do you mean when you understand things it means you become aware of their relationships to each other and eventually you see the unity behind them and it is as if the multiplicity of the world dissolved into unity and so here you encounter a problem I can see the world as a unity I can see the world as a multiplicity but how the devil am I going to put the two visions together if I am to be a practical success in business in family life and so on I have to observe the world of particulars its particulars that matter I have to know chalk from cheese but if I become a saint a monk or a hermit then I care of even perhaps a poet or an artist I will forget about the practical matters and contemplate the unity the secret meaning underlying all events but then every all those practical people are going to say to me you're you're falling down on the job you've escaped from life because they feel that the world of particulars is the real world but the other guy says no your particulars are not real you make a success of things yes but it's completely temporary you think you're an important person that you are really contributing to human life but actually your success in doing this sort of thing lasts for a few years and then you fall apart like everybody else does where's your success now when you're dead what happened to the millions of dollars you made where are you they're all gone so that isn't real from the standpoint of the person who concentrates on the unity so then to perfect our understanding we have to go to the third of these worlds which is called re G mu gay now that means between a re the unity and G the particulars mu there is no gay block that means the world of the universal and the particulars are not incompatible let's take two very different things and see how they can be united take shape and color never in a million years can you with a black pencil that can draw shapes make red but if you have read you can draw a circle you can draw a red circle even though the circle shape and the red color will never be the same yet red circle they go beautifully together so think of circle as G and red as re the circle is the particular the color is the universal they go together so then we might say the properly rounded out person is both spiritual and material both otherworldly and worldly this is the supreme attainment of a human being to be both don't get one-sided a person who is what you might call just a materialist ends up by being very boring it's you know you can live the successful life of the world and you can own every kind of material refinement you can have the most beautiful home delicious food marvelous yachts and cars and everything but if you have no touch of mysticism it eventually is all perfectly boring and you get tired of it then on the other hand there are people who are purely spiritual and they live in a kind of dry world where all luxury has been scrubbed away and they are very intense people when you are in their presence of a very spiritual person an excessively spiritual person you feel inclined to sit on the edge of your chair you are not at ease because you know the eye of judgment is looking through you and going down into your very soul and finding that you're just a scallywag after all and he has this absolutely sincere this dreadfully honest and unselfish person this is something which is always puzzling to people brought up in a Western environment because great spiritual people are often very very sensuous because they they can't be materialists in the ordinary sense they can't be straight open sensuous because for them the world is too wonderful for that any any human being is too marvelous to be treated as just a kind of sexual object they may be very much a sexual object but so marvelous you have to stop with it and really go into the whole of that marvelous wonderful personality so there is a trouble keeps coming up for the West when you go to church and you suddenly go to a church where there's a marvelous clergyman and you think he is the very exemplar of life and you idealize him and then suddenly there develops a frightful scandal that he has an affair with his secretary and you think all is lost that the faith has been sold out that everything's going to rack and ruin because he was not purely spiritual and he himself may be terribly confused and worried about this because in our world you see we make the spiritual and the material mutually exclusive but re ji mu ge this third world means that between the spiritual and the material there is no obstruction so we might say this would sound as if it were the highest level but is one more to come which is called ji ji mu ge this means then suddenly re has disappeared but between ji and ji there is no obstruction between one event and any other event or events there is no mutual exclusiveness shall I put it that way this is the doctrine the highest doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism which you could call the doctrine of the mutual interpenetration of all things or the mutual interdependence of all things and its symbol is the what is called Indra's net that is used in the avatamsaka sutra imagine at dawn and multi-dimensional spider's web covered in dew a vast vast spider's web that is the whole cosmos and is not only a kind of a flat thing but a solid thing and has solid in four five six and n dimensions covered with jewels of dew all of which have rainbow coloring and every drop of dew contains in it the reflection of every other drop of dew and since every drop of dew contains the reflections of all the others each reflected drop of dew contains the reflections you see of all the others and so ad infinitum now this is the Mahayana vision of the world which is to say this is relativity that whatever exists in this world and is characterized as something particular as a thing as an event has something or other you see as a unit this does not exist without all other such things and events so that you might say any one event implies all events and all events the total universe past present and future depends on every single member in other words you may say I can understand that I depend on this whole universe there could not be me unless there was everything else it is harder to see the corollary of that that the whole universe depends on you you might say well how can that be because I come into being and then I go out of being and when I'm before I was born I'm sure the universe was here and after I die I'm sure it will go on how can you say then that the whole thing depends on me very simply it depends on your supposing you're dead and we are talking about someone in the past let's say we're talking about Socrates and I'm going to say this whole universe depends on Socrates I may put it more exactly it depends on Socrates having existed you see your parents now some of your parents may be alive but some of your parents may be dead without your parents he would not have come into being so you depend on your parents even when your parents have gone so everything even when you disappear the universe will still depend on you on your having been here or if you have not yet arrived it depends on your going to be here so we can say obviously going back to Socrates that the fact that Socrates existed tells us something about the kind of world we're living in this world once Socrates and that Socrates and his wisdom was a symptom of the kind of universe we're living in in just the same way as I showed you that an apple is a symptom of a tree certain kind of tree tells us something about that tree what it functions how it produces things so a world which produced Socrates or a world which produced John Doe who was nobody in particular and nobody ever remembered him or thought to write his biography nevertheless for all his obscurity the whole universe depends on him and it depends equally on every fruit fly every gnat every vibration of every gnats wing and it depends on every last electron however brief its manifestation may be so that what what this is saying is that everything that there is implies everything else and all those other things collectively in their totality which we call the universe in turn imply each individual object event and so on that's the meaning of Indra's net so that this is called in Zen to take up a blade of grass and use it as a golden Buddha 16 feet high when you have a chain and you pick up a link all the other links come up with it you see because it implies if this is a link it is a link in a chain if it isn't it's just an oval piece of metal but if it's a link up come all other links so if you are an event every event no no there's no such thing as a single event the only possible single event is all events whatsoever that could be regarded as the only possible atom the only possible single thing is everything but the things that we call things all imply each other we know what we are only in relation to what we aren't we know of the sensation of oneself only in relation to a sensation of something other so the other goes with the self as the back goes with the front and your life however short everything depends on it if that did not happen nothing would happen so in this sense the whole world bears your signature it would not be the same world if it weren't for you you've heard haven't you what is called the pathetic fallacy this was a idea of the 19th century which said that it was false wrong to project human feelings on the world the wind in the pine trees is not sighing it's you who are sighing the Sun is not happy it's you are who are happy when the sun shines so don't mix up your happiness with the Sun the Sun has no feeling the Sun is not human the wind has no feeling and is not human the poet says the moon doth with delight look round her when the heavens are bare and the logician says no the poet looks round with the light of the moon in the bare heavens how awful I mean if that's what if that's the point you see better not say any poetry just have prose but actually the moon does look round with the light when the poet looks round with the light because the world of which one symptom is the moon is the same world of which another symptom is the poet they go together a world where there is a moon implies a world where there is a poet a world where there is a poet implies a world where there is a moon so in this sense the moon can be said to look round with the light through the agency of the poet because you can't separate poet and moon just as you can't separate head and feet without destroying the unity of the body so in that sense then this whole world is a human world and we should not take the silly attitude philosophy called the philosophy of the pathetic fallacy which says outside our skins it's all inhuman and dumb and blind force and only inside the skin is there a human world all this world is human because it depends not only on the existence of humanity in general but on the existence of Mary Smith in particular so the whole world is covered as it were with your personal signature but at that moment when you suddenly seem to be everything and to be Mr.\n",
      "+A you know you suddenly see the obverse of this that your particular personality is nothing at all without everything else without everybody else I need in order to be Alan Watts I need every single other human being and the uncontrollable otherness of all those other human beings that I can't do anything about they are going to be themselves whatever I do and yet at the same time I depend on all their difference from me and yet they all depend likewise on me so that I'm in a very funny position the moment I would be egoless and say I am nothing without you then suddenly I find I'm the kingpin they all depend on me then suddenly when I get swelled headed about being the kingpin I find I'm nothing at all without them so everything keeps going blip blip blip blip in other words the moment you think you've got it in one state it transforms itself into the other that's the Gigi Muge now in Gigi Muge you see you've got a vision of the world in which everybody is boss and nobody is boss there is no one boss who governs the whole thing it takes care of itself it's a colossal democracy but yet every man and every uguisu and every snail is king in this world and at the same time is commoner and that's how it works and there is no great king although in Hinduism they have an idea a very strange one to us called Ishvara Ishvara means the supreme personal God the top being in the deva world and they many Buddhists believe that there is such a God there is a ruler of the universe but he is lower than a Buddha because in the course of the endless cycles Ishvara will dissolve into nothing all gods all angels are within the round of being it's a very curious idea to our our minds and therefore although Buddhists believe in God in that sense they don't take it importantly there are no shrines in Buddhism to Ishvara so then it is through Gigi Muge this idea of the mutual interpenetration and interdependence of all things that we have the philosophical basis for Zen as a practical non-intellectual way of life because of the realization that the most ordinary event the charcoal brazier the mat soup for dinner sneezing washing your hands going to the bathroom everything all these so-called events separate events imply the universe so this is why Zen people will use the ordinary event to demonstrate the cosmic and the metaphysical only they don't rationalize it that way to see infinity in a grain of sand and eternity in an hour is still Rigi Muge and not Gigi Muge Gigi Muge is when you offer somebody the grain of sand for God's sake stop thinking about eternity here's just the grain of sand there is no difference between the grain of sand and eternity so you don't have to think about eternity as something implied by the grain of sand the grain of sand is eternity so in the same way exactly our sitting here at this moment is not something different from Nirvana we are Nirvana as sitting here exactly like this you see so you don't have to say any philosophical comment on the grain of sand or on our sitting here that's called legs on a snake or a beard on a unit you put legs on a snake you see and you embarrass the snake in its motion and a unit doesn't need a beard we would say in our idiom don't guild the lily or Zen would say don't put frost on top of snow so all what you might call specifically religious activity is legs on a snake eventually this is going to be eliminated just as eventually we hope that government will be eliminated and will become unnecessary because every individual will be self-governing and therefore relate properly to his brother and the state will vanish so too at the same time the church will vanish and that's why in the in the book of Revelation in the New Testament it is said that in heaven there is no temple because the whole place is the temple so in when we achieve the fulfillment of Buddhism there is no Buddha no temple no gong no bell because the whole world is the sound of the bell and the image of Buddha is everything you can look at so as then master was asked mountains and hills are they not all forms of the body of Buddha the master replied yes they are but it's a pity to say so\n",

      "+The popular theory of karma the word that literally means action or doing in Sanskrit so that when we say that something that happens to you is your karma it's like saying in English it's your own doing but in in popular Indian belief karma is a sort of built-in moral law or a law of retribution such that all the bad things you do and all the good things you do have consequences which you have to inherit and so long as karmic energy remains all the bad things you do and all the good things you do have consequences which you have to inherit and so long as karmic energy remains stored up you have to work it out and what the sage endeavors to do is a kind of action which in Sanskrit is called nishkama karma.\n",
      "+Nishkama means without passion or without attachment karma action and so whether he whatever action he does he renounces the fruits of the action so that he acts in a way that doesn't generate future karma because future karma continues you in the wheel of becoming sansara the round and keeps you being reincarnated now then in that case when the time comes that you start to get out of the chain of karma all the creditors that you have start presenting themselves for payment in other words a person who begins say to study yoga is felt that he will suddenly get sick or that his children will die or that he loses money or all sorts of catastrophes will occur because the karmic debt is being cleared up and it there's in no hurry to be cleared up if you're just living along like anybody but if you embark on the spiritual life a certain hurry occurs and therefore since this is known it's rather discouraging to start these things the Christian way of saying the same thing is that if you plan to be to change your life shall we say to turn over a new leaf you mustn't let the devil know because he will oppose you with all his might if he suddenly discovers that you're going to escape from his power so for example if you have a bad habit say you drink too much and you make a new year's resolution that during this coming year you will stop drinking that's a very very dangerous thing to do because the devil will immediately know about it and what will happen will be this he will confront you with the prospect of 365 drinkless days and that will be awful you know just overwhelming and you won't be able to make much more than three days on the wagon so in that case you compromise with the devil and say just today I'm not going to drink you see but tomorrow maybe you know we'll go back then when tomorrow comes you say oh just another day let's try out that's all and the next day you say oh one more day won't make much difference so you only do it for the moment and you don't let the devil know that you have a secret intention of going on day after day after day after day but of course there's something still better than that and that is not to let the devil know anything that means of course not to let yourself know one of the many meanings of that saying let not your left hand know what your right hand do it is just this and that was why in Zen discipline a great deal of it centers around acting without premeditation as those of you know who read harigals book Zen in the art of archery it was necessary to release the bow string without first saying now there's a wonderful story who may also have read by a German writer von Kleist about a boxing match with a bear the man can never defeat this bear because the bear always knows his plans in advance and is ready to deal with any situation the only way to get through to the bear would be to hit the bear without having first intended to do so that would catch him and so this is one of the great great problems in the spiritual life or whatever you want to call it is to be able to have intention and act simultaneous by this means you escape karma and you escape the devil so you might say that the Taoist is exemplary in this respect that this is getting free from karma without making any previous announcement of simply supposing we have a train and we want to unload the train of its freight cars you can go to the back end and you can unload them one by one and shunt them into the side but the simplest of all ways of unloading is to uncouple between the engine and the first car and that gets rid of the whole bunch at once and it is in that sort of way you see that the Taoist gets rid of karma without challenging it and so it has the reputation you see of being the easy way there are all kinds of yoga's and ways for people who want to be difficult and one of the great gambits of a man like good Jeff was to make it all seem as difficult as possible because that challenge the vanity of his students if some teacher some guru says really this isn't difficult at all that's perfectly easy some people will say oh he's not really the real thing we want something tough and difficult and when we see somebody starts out giving you a discipline that's very very weird and rigid people think now there is the thing that that man means business see and so they flatter themselves by going to such a guy that they are serious students whereas the other people are only dabblers and so on all right if you have to do it that way that's the way you have to do it but the Taoist has is the kind of person who shows you the shortcut and shows you how to do it by intelligence rather than effort because that's what it is Taoism is in that sense what everybody is looking for the easy way in the shortcut using cleverness instead of muscle so the question naturally arises isn't it cheating when in any game somebody really starts using his intelligence he will very likely be accused of cheating and to draw the line between skill and cheating is a very difficult thing to do you see the the inferior intelligence will always accuse a superior intelligence of cheating that's its way of saving face you beat me by means that weren't fair we were originally having a contest to find out who had the strongest muscles and you know we were pushing against it like this this this this this and this would prove who had the strongest muscles but then you introduce some gimmick into it some judo trick or something like that you see and you're not playing fair so in the whole domain of ways of liberation there are roots for the stupid people and roots for the intelligent people and the latter are faster this was perfectly clearly explained by Hoi Nang the six patriarch of Zen in China in his Sutra where he says the difference between the gradual school and the sudden school is they both arrive at the same point but the gradual is for slow witted people and the sudden is for fast witted people can you in other words find a way that sees into your own nature that sees into the Tao immediately and at the end of this morning's talk I pointed out to you the immediate way the way through now when you know that this moment is the Tao and this moment is by its considered by itself without past and without future eternal neither coming into being nor going out of being there there is Nirvana and there is a whole Chinese philosophy of time based on this it hasn't to my knowledge been very much discussed by Taoist writers it's been more discussed by Buddhist writers but it's all based on the same thing Dogen the great 13th century Japanese Zen Buddhist studied in China and he wrote a book called Shobo Genzo a Roshi recently said to me in Japan that's a terrible book because it tells you everything it gives the whole secret away but in the course of this book he says you don't there is no such thing as a progression in time the spring does not become the summer there is first spring and then there is summer so in the same way you now do not become you later this is T.S.\n",
      "+Eliot's idea in Four Quartets where he says that the person who has settled down in the train to read the newspaper is not the same person who stepped onto the train from the platform and therefore also you who sit here are not the same people who came in at the door these states are separate each in its own place there was the coming in at the door person but there is actually only the here and now sitting person and the person sitting here and now is not the person who will die because we are all a constant flux and the continuity of the person from past through present to future is as illusory in its own way as the upward movement of the red lines on a revolving barber pole you know it goes round and round and round and the whole thing seems to be going up or going down whichever the case may be but actually nothing is going up or down so when you throw a pebble into the pond and you make a concentric rings of waves there is an illusion that the water is flowing outwards and no water is flowing outwards at all water is only going up and down what appears to move outward is the wave not the water so this kind of philosophical argument says that our seeming to go along in a course of time it doesn't really happen the buddhist say suffering exists but no one who suffers deeds exist but no doers are found a path there is but no one who follows it and Nirvana is but no one who attains it so in this way they look upon the continuity of life as the same sort of illusion that is produced when you take a cigarette and in the dark world it and the illusion of a circle is created whereas there is only the one point of fire the argument then is so long as you're in the present there aren't any problems the problems exist only when you allow presence to amalgamate there's a way of putting this in Chinese which is rather interesting they have a very interesting sign this it pronounced Nyan Japanese men and the top part of the character means now and the bottom part means the mind heart the shin and so this is as it were an instant of thought in Sanskrit they use it they use this character as the equivalent for the Sanskrit word Shana then if you put if you double this character put it twice or three times and I'll write the Chinese for ditto Nyan Nyan Nyan means thought after thought after thought now the the Zen master joshua was once asked what is the mind of a child and he said a ball in a mountain stream what do you mean by a ball in a mountain stream he said thought after thought after thought with no block so he was using of course the mind of the child as the innocent mind the mind of a person who's enlightened one thought follows another without hesitation the thought arises it doesn't wait to arise as when you clap your hands the sound issues without hesitation when you strike flint the spark comes out it doesn't wait to come out and that means that there's no block so thought thought thought Nyan Nyan Nyan describes what we call in our world the stream of consciousness blocking consists in letting the the stream become connected changed together in such a way that when the present thought arises it seems to be dragging its past or resisting its future saying I don't want to go when then the connection the dragging it's better to call it of these thoughts drops you've broken the chain of karma if you think of this in comparison with certain problems in music it's very interesting because when we listen to music we hear melody only because we remember the sequence we hear the intervals between the tones but more than that we remember the tones that led up to the one we are now hearing and we are trained musically to anticipate certain consequences and to the extent that we get the consequences we anticipate we feel that we understand the music but to the extent that the composer does not adhere to the rules and gives us unexpected consequences we feel that we don't understand the music and if he gives us harmonic relationships which we are not trained to accept that is to say to expect we say well this man is just writing garbage but of course it becomes apparent that the perception of music the ability to hear melody will depend upon a relationship between past present and future sounds and you might say well you're talking about a way of living that would be equivalent to listening to music with a tone deaf mind so that you would reduce you would eliminate the melody and have only noise and so in your darwist way of life you would eliminate all meaning and have only senseless present moments up to a point that's true that is in a way what Buddhists and also mean by seeing things in their suchness what is so bad about dying for example it's really no problem when you die you just drop dead that's all there is to it but what makes it a problem is that you're dragging a past and all those things you've done all those achievements you've made all these relationships and people that you've accumulated as your friends all that has to go see it isn't here now means a few friends might be around you but all that past that identifies you as who you are which is simply memory all that has to go and we feel just terrible about that but if we didn't if we were just dying that's all death wouldn't be a problem so likewise the chores of everyday life they become intolerable when everything ties together all the past in the future you feel it dragging at you every way supposing you wake up in the morning and it's a lovely morning let's take today right here and now here we are in this paradise of the place Big Sur and some of us have got to go to work on Monday is that a problem for many people it is it spoils the taste of what's going on now when we wake up in bed on Monday morning and think of the various hurdles we've got to jump that day immediately we feel sad and bored and bothered whereas actually we're just lying in bed so the Taoist trick says simply live now and there will be no problems that's the meaning of the Zen saying when you are hungry eat when you are tired sleep when you walk walk when you sit sit Rinzai the great Tang Dynasty master said in the practice of Buddhism there is no place for using effort sleep when you're tired move your bowels eat when you're hungry that's all the ignorant will laugh at me but the wise will understand and so also the meaning of this wonderful Zen saying day of the character for the Sun day that is good day every day is a good day on condition you see that day day is like nyan nyan they come one after another and yet there's only this one you don't link them this is I said into intimated just a moment ago seems to be an atomization of life things just do what they do the flower goes poof and people go this way go that way and so on and that's that's what's happening it has no meaning it has no destination it has no value it's just like that and when you see that you see it's a great relief that's all it is but then when you are firmly established in suchness in that it's just this moment you can begin again to play with the connections only you've seen through them and but now you see that they don't haunt you because you know that there isn't any continuous you running on from moment to moment who originated at some time in the past and will die at some time in the future all that disappeared so you can have enormous fun anticipating the future remembering the past and playing all kinds of continuities this is the meaning of that famous Zen saying about mountains are mountains to the naive man mountains are mountains waters are waters to the intermediate student mountains are no longer mountains waters are no longer waters now the words they've all dissolved into the point instant to the chana but for the fully perfected student mountains are again mountains and waters are again waters\n",
