        "This is a simplified script for fine-tuning GPT2 using Hugging Face's [Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) and PyTorch.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should understand the basics of PyTorch and how a training loop works before getting started. [This official PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) serves as an excellent introduction. Familiarity with the workings of GPT2 might be useful but isn't required. The code has been written for clarity and not re-use. I'd advise refactoring it for actual projects. I've liberally taken bits from [Chris McCormick's BERT fine-tuning tutorial](https://mccormickml.com/2019/07/22/BERT-fine-tuning/), [Ian Porter's GPT2 tutorial](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html) and the [Hugging Face Language model fine-tuning script](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.0.0/examples.html#language-model-fine-tuning) so full credit to them. Chris' code has pretty much provided the basis for this script - you should definitely check out his [blog](https://mccormickml.com/tutorials/).\n",
        "\n",
        "I should mention what the script doesn't cover:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Using the [nlp](https://huggingface.co/nlp/) library to load in the dataset and setting up the training workflow, which looks to streamline things rather nicely.\n",
        "- [Accumulated gradients](https://medium.com/huggingface/training-larger-batches-practical-tips-on-1-gpu-multi-gpu-distributed-setups-ec88c3e51255) - this gives larger effective batch sizes than Colab allows (GPT2 is a large model, and anything more than a batch size of 2 would be enough to get a CUDA out of memory error on Colab).\n",
        "- [Freezing layers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/1431). This is the process of only changing the parameters in selected layers, made famous by the [ULMFit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) process.\n",
        "- [Using 'past'](https://huggingface.co/transformers/quickstart.html#using-the-past) when generating text. This takes in the previous state when generating successive items of text. I didn't need it.\n",
        "- [Tensor packing](https://snappishproductions.com/blog/2020/03/01/chapter-9.5-text-generation-with-gpt-2-and-only-pytorch.html.html). This is a neat way of fitting in as much training data in each batch.\n",
        "- [Hyperparameter search](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/using-hyperparameter-search-in-trainer/785/10). I settled quickly on values that seemed to produce decent values, without checking if they were optimal."

            "3733 The highest kind of a Buddha is like an ordinary person and this comes out very very much in various tendencies in Zen where for example all the painting peculiarly characteristic of Zen Buddhism in the Chinese and Japanese tradition is as it were secular it has a peculiarly non-religious atmosphere that is to say the painting of Shingon sect and Tendai sect as you saw it in the museum today was religious painting you could tell at once that the subject matter of these paintings is religious but with Zen painting the way of dealing with philosophical on spiritual themes is secular so that when an artist like Sengai living in the 17th century Japan paints the Buddha there is something slightly humorous about the Buddha he wears his halo over one ear there is an informality a slight roughness and so this comes from China from those great song artists like Liang Kai who painted the six patriarch of Zen chopping bamboos looking like the most extraordinarily unkempt country oaf so also the greatest Zen painting has as its subject matter not really religious themes at all it uses pine branches rocks bamboos grasses everything of that kind and you would never know that these things were icons likewise also in poetry which we will go into more extensively in the future the superb expression of Zen poetry is derived from the Chinese poet Hōkōji who says wondrous action supernatural power drawing water carrying fuel now that's that poem is a little bit too religious for Zen taste and so preferable to that is Barsho's famous poem the old pond a frog jumps in plop plop is the only possible English translation for the Japanese means no auto which means literally the waters sound plop but that poem you see is very high styles end poem because it has nothing in it about religion there is a poem on the edge which also was written by Barsho which says when the lightning flashes how admirable he who does not think life is fleeting you see the flash of a lightning is a Buddhist cliche for the transiency of the world your life goes by and disappears as fast as a flash of lightning that becomes a cliche so all religion all religious comments about life eventually become cliches religion always is falling apart and becoming a certain kind of going through the motions a kind of imitation of attitudes as if one would say we've got a book called the imitation of Christ to terrible book because everybody who imitates Christ is a kind of a fake Jesus so in the same way there's all kinds of imitation Buddhas not just sitting on altars made of wood gilded but just sitting around in monasteries so one might say then that the highest kind of religious or spiritual attainment has no no way a sign about it that it is religious or that it is spiritual and so as a metaphor for this there was used in Buddhism from the very beginning the idea of the tracks of birds in the sky they don't leave any tracks and so the way of the enlightened man is like the track of a bird in the sky and as one poem a Chinese poem says entering the forest he does not disturb a blade of grass entering the water he does not make a ripple in other words there is no sign about him to indicate that he is self-consciously religious and this goes to for the fact that he's not having any religious sign is also not something contrived it isn't like Protestant simplicity you know all those Catholics with their rituals and how dreadful and the sincere that is with the real reason you know why Protestant think Catholic ritual is insincere you know it's expensive Protestantism started in the burger cities of Europe places like Freiburg you know and Geneva because the merchant class who were the foundation of the bourgeoisie got annoyed because every time a Saints Day came around all their employees got a day off because it was a holy day and they had to attend mass there were so many of these nuisance holy days and all these contributions that were assessed by the church buying your way out of purgatory and saying masses for the dead and so on and so forth they found this not very economical the priests were getting the money instead of the merchants and so they decried as unbiblical and irreligious and wasteful all the finery of the Catholic religion and wanted something plain and simple so it became in course of time a sign of being really religious to avoid rituals and to avoid colorful clothing and splendor in churches and to be as ordinary as possible but that is not yet the real religion of me giving no sign of having a religion because this simplicity and absence of ritual itself becomes a sign a way of advertising how spiritual you are so the completely bodhisattva type of person doesn't leave any track either by being religious overtly or by being non-religious overtly how will you be neither religious nor non-religious see that's the great test how will you avoid that trap of being one or the other it's like are you a theist or are you an atheist see the theist is caught by God and the idea of God the belief in God but the atheist is equally caught because an atheist is very often an atheist because he cannot stand the idea that God is watching him all the time that there is this constant all-seeing eye prying on your most private life and that there's this you know how when you're a child in school and you're writing something or doing arithmetic and the teacher walks around the class and looks over your shoulder nobody wants to be watched like that even someone who is good at writing or arithmetic doesn't want somebody looking over their shoulder while they're doing it it puts you off it bugs you so the idea of the Lord God who is watching us all the time who is judging everything that we do puts people off and they can't stand it so better be an atheist to get rid of teacher so but the atheist you see the man who advertises his disbelief in God is a very pious person nobody believes in God like an atheist there is no God and I am his prophet so then the true bodhisattva state is very difficult to pin down as being either neither supremely religious nor blatantly secular and people who think that the height of Buddhism or the height of Zen is to be perfectly ordinary have still missed the point like the atheist has missed the point but for this reason then there is an element in the art the painting etc which has been inspired by this kind of Buddhism this kind of art where the subject matter is non-religious nevertheless there is something about the way in which this non-religious subject matter is handled that stops you and you know there's something strange about it this is how I first became interested in oriental philosophy and all that kind of thing I had an absolute fascination for Chinese and Japanese painting the secular painting the landscapes the treatment of flowers and grasses and bamboos there was something about it that struck me as astonishing even though the subject matter was extremely ordinary and I just as a child practically I had to find out what was the strange element in those bamboos and those grasses I was being of course taught by those painters to see grass but there was something in there that one could never pin down never put your finger on and that was this thing that I will call the religion of no religion the supreme attainment of being a Buddha who can't be detected who in this sense then leaves no trace you remember some of you have seen those ten paintings called the ten stages of spiritual ox herding and the the author there are two sets of these paintings there's a heterodox one and an orthodox one the heterodox one has the as the man catches the ox it gets progressively whiter until in the end it disappears altogether and the last picture is an empty circle but the orthodox set of paintings doesn't end with the empty circle that the empty circle arises two from the end three from the end it is followed by two others after the man has attained the state of emptiness the state in other words of complete iconoclasm the state of no attachment to any spiritual or psychological or moral crutch there are two more steps one is called returning to the origin which is represented by a tree beside a stream and the final one called entering the city with hands hanging down that means the hands giving a handout as it were giving bounty and it shows the picture of the fat Buddha putai or in Japanese known as Hotei who is an enormous belly big ears who carries around a colossal bag and what do you think this bag has in it trash wonderful trash everything that children love things that everybody else has thrown away and thought of as valueless this bum collects and gives it away to children and so it says here that he goes on his way without following the steps of the ancient sages his door is closed his kids that's the door of his house and no glimpses of his interior life are to be seen so in other words it's like when you erect a building while you're building it you have all kinds of scaffolding up that shows you that building is going on but when the building is complete the scaffolding is taken down to open a door as they say in Zen you may need to pick up a brick to knock at the door but when the door is open you don't carry the brick inside to cross the river you need a boat but when you reach the other side you don't pick up the boat and carry it so the brick the boat the scaffolding all these things represent some sort of religious technology or and in the end these are all to disappear so that the saint will not be found in church I don't take what I say literally the saint can perfectly readily go to church without being sullied by church but ordinary people when they go to church they come out stinking of religion there was a great Zen master once and one of his disciples asked him how am I making progress he said you're all right but you have a trivial fault well what is that he said you have too much Zen well he said when you're studying Zen don't you think it's very natural to be talking about it the master said when it's like an ordinary conversation it is much better and so another monk who was standing by listening to this exchange said to the master why do you so specially dislike talking about Zen and he replied because it turns one's stomach so what did he mean when he said when it's like an ordinary everyday conversation it is somewhat better when the old master joshua was asked at the end of the kalpa when everything is destroyed in fire there will be one thing remaining what is that and joshua replied it's windy again this morning so in Zen when you're asked a question about religion you reply in terms of the secular when you are asked about something secular you reply in terms of religion so what is the eternal nature of the self it's windy again this morning please pass me a knife the master hands him the knife with a blade first please give me the other end what would you do with the other end see here the disciple starts out with the ordinary please pass me the knife and suddenly he finds himself involved in a metaphysical problem but if he starts out with the metaphysical he's going to get involved with a knife so now to go deeply into the religion of non-religion we have to understand the what you might call the final ultimate attainment of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy and this is contained in a school of thought which is called in Chinese Hua Yan and in Japanese kegon kegon is the intellectual foundation for Zen and there was a great Chinese master by the name of Schumann who was simultaneously a Zen master and the fifth patriarch of the Huan Yan sect.\n",

But the following year, in 2015 the project progressed into a more serious endeavor. That was the project that brought Marcel Dettmann together with Daniel Orphara, Daniel Pantaleon, and Sebastian Thorne. As a reaction to Pantaleon's decision to close the project, Marcel Dettmann began to search for music to make the project sustainable, and in 2016 he decided to begin a new project. Called The Rave Recordings Company, or simply The Rave Recordings Organization, it’s a collective of musicians working together to create beats for some of the most influential electronic music on the planet.\n",

He started producing with his friend and sound engineer, Joris Voorn, under the alias “The Rave Radio Project” in 2017. Since then the project has evolved into the more serious project of the project known as The Rave Exchange, a new label formed on the principles of collaboration and sharing the knowledge, creativity, and ideas of artists. Currently The Rave Exchange is composed of all the residents of Berlin, with whom Marcel Dettmann has a deep connection. The Rave Exchange’s goal is to provide a platform for artists in various fields, from the clubbing to the film and theatre industry.\n",

Around this time he formed Tresor and quickly became one of its most important and sought after DJs. Throughout his earlier years, Krivit was also active in localised fashion agencies and his monthly show 'Krivit' was a regular feature in various local parties and boutiques.
